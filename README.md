# Sudoku-

This is a simple program for solving sudoku puzzles of various difficulties in the least time available. The encouragement to
write this very program was gained from Project Euler problem #96. 

https://projecteuler.net/problem=96

The first solution implemented by myself used a brute force alghoritm to find an appropriate combination of numbers that fit
the rules of the sudoku puzzle. Current implementation is an optimization which first uses a series of some known sudoku alghoritms to
fill as much before again attempting the brute force technique. While implementing these alghoritms following link was helpful as it 
explained the alghoritms and best way to combine them in order to solve a puzzle.

The program takes the name of the file including the sudoku puzzles as an argument.
The format of the file is left same as it is given in the problem. 
A sample for format is as following.
